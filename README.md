## Overview

TriviaDart is a simple Trivia web application that utilizes both the [Open Trivia DB ](https://opentdb.com/) and [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com/), which both offer generous free API usage. TriviaDart also has an in-house API that has over 45,000 trivia questions. Currently, there are no options available for these questions, but this will be added in the future. The in-house API utilizes Supabase.

TriviaDart allows you to select one of the above mentioned APIs, a category (`Any` by default), and the ability to show multiple choice options if you are stuck!

## Install

You are able to install TriviaDart as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) on any modern device. This will allow the application to be "installed" and appear like any other application on your phone/tablet/desktop. To install TriviaDart as a PWA, follow these steps:

### Desktop:

1. Go to [TriviaDart](https://triviadart.com) in your browser.
2. Depending on your browser, the next steps may change.
3. Click on the "install" icon in the URL bar (often at the far-right end next to the share or favorite buttons).
4. More information can be found in the [Mozilla Developer Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable#installation_from_the_web).

### Mobile:

1. Go to [TriviaDart](https://triviadart.com) in your browser.
2. Depending on your browser, the next steps may change.
3. If you are on iOS Safari, click the "Share" button, then click "Add to Home Screen".
