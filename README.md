## ⚙️ Configuration

### 🛠️ Environment Variables

- `VITE_ENABLE_TRIVIADART` (default: `false`)
  - Set to `true` to enable the TriviaDart (Supabase) source.

If using your own Supabase backend, also set:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_APIKEY`
- `VITE_TRIVIA_DART_APIKEY` (if needed)

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your variables.

## 🗄️ Hosting Your Own TriviaDart Source (Optional)

If you want to use your own Supabase backend:
- Set up a `questions` table with the following columns:

| Column Name         | Data Type |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| `id`                | int4      |
| `category`          | text      |
| `question`          | text      |
| `answer`            | text      |
| `incorrect_answers` | text[]    |

- The data inside the `incorrect_answers` column should be a text array, e.g.:

```json
["wrong answer 1", "wrong answer 2", "wrong answer 3"]
```

- You are free to use the `trivia.csv` file found in this repository to populate your own database. The questions inside this csv were sourced from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/trivia/comments/3wzpvt/free_database_of_50000_trivia_questions/). The `incorrect_answers` text[] were created using OpenAI's GPT-4o model and may be incorrect.
